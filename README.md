Temperature Conversion Program
This Temperature Conversion Program is a simple yet efficient tool designed to help users convert temperature values between three common units: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). The program offers a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless input of a temperature value, followed by a selection of the unit in which the temperature is provided. Once the unit is chosen, the program performs the necessary mathematical conversion and outputs the corresponding temperatures in the other two units.

The program supports conversions in all directions—whether you're converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, and so on. It is ideal for anyone working with temperatures in different scales, such as students, engineers, scientists, or anyone needing quick and accurate temperature calculations for everyday tasks.

In addition to basic temperature conversions, the program handles edge cases (such as absolute zero in Kelvin) and provides clear, easy-to-read results. Its intuitive design ensures that even users with little technical knowledge can use it effectively.

Key features include:

Simple input for temperature values and unit selection.
Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Instant output of converted values in all three units.
Handles both positive and negative temperature values.
Clear error messages for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).
Overall, the Temperature Conversion Program is an essential tool for quick and reliable temperature conversions, saving time and effort for anyone needing to work with various temperature scales.
